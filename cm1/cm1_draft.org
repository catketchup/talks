** 
? how curved sky better than flat sky; compare between them? 
? isotropic? unlensed CMB multipoles are assumed to be Gaussian and statistically isotropic(explain)
? name of l and alm

** 
? code source
? declining geometric kernel of CMB lensing at these high redshifs.

? compton scattering and Thomson scattering: Thomson scattering is the elastic scattering of electromagnetic radiation by a free charged particle, as described by classical electromagnetism. It is the low-energy limit of Compton scattering: the particle's kinetic energy and photon frequency do not change as a result of the scattering. This limit is valid as long as the photon energy is much smaller than the mass energy of the particle: , or equivalently, if the wavelength of the light is much greater than the Compton wavelength of the particle.

Reionization: At a redshift of about 10, hydrogen gets ionized again by the ultraviolet radiation of the first structures
kSZ: 



tSZ effect: CMB photons interact with electrons that have high energies due to their temperature
kSZ effect 
kSZ anisotropies: are produced in cosmological epochs during which there are large fluctuations in the electron density. ? (physical image)
``kSZ'' is used to refer to any blackbody temperature fluctuation arising from bulk motion integrated along the line of sight, including the Doppler effect.

? We refer to the Doppler effect as responsible for large-angle kSZ anisotropies.
? bulk velocity
? patchy reionization
? (B+C+E)

This applies to the simulated temperature full-sky map by now. My next setp would be improving its performance and applying polarization maps and then considering patchy maps.
