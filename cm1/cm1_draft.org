Lensing reconstruction

* What is CMB lensing?
** explain cmb lensing

** cmb lensing and T,E,B modes
* Why lensing reconstruction?
** premordial GW
** dark matter
** delensing
** lensing cross-correlation
* How lensing reconstruction?
** lensing reconstruction
estimators
** lensing reconstruction on cut-sky
** lensing reconstruction on full-sly
*** show work
*** future plan on lensing reconstruction
* bias to cmb lensing reconstruction to reionization ksz
** reionization
** ksz
** explain how reionization ksz affects lensing reconstruction

* appendix


GW, tensor mode, polarization, EB mode
B mode sources
cmb tempature, polarization fields, fourier space, off-diagnal terms
noise model! noise unit!

* questions
- patchy tau
- optial depth
- reionization and ksz!!!
- lensing potential and convergence
- transfer functions
- matrix degree of freedom
- scales! units!


- cosmological parameters understanding
- lensing effect scale
- lensing effect on TT, TB, EB, order
- ell and angular scale and pixells
- B mode other contributions
- B mode other sources
- vector modes

- large scale, intermediate redshifts
- newlens alm and lensing map


- trispectrum
- reionization ksz affects lensing reconstruction physical image
- bias to lensing reconstruction from reionization ksz: temperature field and polarization field, scale?
- noise, map noise, noise level, N_pix in paperlaptop
- event horizon and gravitationl wave scales
- show results and preliminary conclusion

This applies to the simulated temperature full-sky map by now. My next setp would be improving its performance and applying polarization maps and then considering patchy maps.

- lensing
- future plan related to lensing?
- full-sky and flat-sky comparison
- lensing reconstruction
** what?
** why?
** B mode topic
premodial B mode and tensor mode
** scalar-vector-tensor mode decomposition
** gravitational waves
** quadrupole and premordial B mode
** Q,U and E,B picture
- lecture notes in cosmology
- search E-mode and B-mode
- search stokes parameters and E-mode,B-mode in the "lectures notes in cosmology"
